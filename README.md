# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
## Overview of Project
An up and coming playright needs help to start a crowd funding campaign for a new play "Fever".
### Purpose
Gather data to determine if the playright will have a successful campaign using a budget of $10,000.
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis of the data is relatively straight forward.  The challenges are dealing with a large accumulation of data makes if pertinent to filter and define the data specifically for the project goals.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data shows that successful Kickstarter campaigns tent to start in April and peak through May. Fall and winter campaigns tend to failed more than other timelines. The first few months of the year is the best for live campaigns.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The goals $25,000 to $30,000 and $45,000+ have the most significant percentages of successful.  
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges encountered were using the countifs data to pull multiple data types.  It requires more manual work to update the lines of code dependant on the columns.
## Results
The data is conistant with successful campaigns in the midrange of the goal being more successful when launched in the spring.
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
A campaign should be lauched late April in to May to have the best outcome of being successful.  Campaigns started in October have a higher chance of failure.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Campaigns with small budgets, such as this playright's $10,000, have a higher percentage of failer.  In order to increase the success rate the playright would need to more than double the budget.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
A huge limitation is the knowledge of where the pledges came from.  Knowing if it's private donors, scholar or entities donating could help the playright determine the best avenue for fundraising.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a graph of staff picks and the use of spotlight for goals and launch date to determine if these are significant factors.
